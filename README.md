**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-KunjPatel03/tree/master/linux_sql)]: A user-friendly solution to efficiently manage a 10-server cluster. The solution allows server users to easily monitor hardware and usage information, ensuring smooth operation and maintenance. Implemented with bash scripts, it seamlessly integrates into existing workflows. PostgreSQL (psql) is chosen as the database technology for reliable data storage. The project is implemented within a Docker container for consistent execution and compatibility. Using Git version control, development progress is tracked. This monitoring solution empowers users to optimize resource allocation, enhancing stability and efficiency of the server cluster for seamless operations.

**JDBC App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-KunjPatel03/tree/master/core_java/jdbc)]: The JDBC application is a robust system for performing essential CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a database, utilizing the powerful JDBC API. It integrates a PostgreSQL database within a Docker container environment, with Maven as the package management and dependency resolution tool, and Git as the chosen version control system.


## Highlighted Projects
**Relational Database Management System** [[GitHub](https://github.com/KunjPatel03/RelationalDatabase)]: Developed a robust RDBMS from scratch using Java, providing support for SQL queries, CRUD operations, and transactions. Implemented a sophisticated parsing and validation mechanism utilizing complex regex expressions for accurate data processing. Designed a custom file format to efficiently store data and metadata. Incorporated multiuser concurrent execution capabilities to ensure data consistency during simultaneous interactions. Utilized reverse engineering techniques to generate an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for visual representation of the database structure. This project showcased my ability to create advanced software systems, empowering users to effectively manage their data and leverage the power of SQL queries.

**Chess game** [[GitHub](https://github.com/KunjPatel03/Chess)]: A console-based chess game application was developed in Java, offering an engaging experience for users to play against the computer. The application adhered to SOLID principles and employed the factory design pattern to ensure maintainability and extensibility. A Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach was applied, with extensive JUnit test cases written to validate the code and modularize its components. The development process followed an Agile methodology, allowing for iterative and collaborative development. To streamline the development workflow, a CI/CD pipeline was implemented to automate monitoring and deployment processes. This comprehensive approach resulted in a well-structured and thoroughly tested chess game application, delivering a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
