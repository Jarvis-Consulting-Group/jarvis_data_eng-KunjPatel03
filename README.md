**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-KunjPatel03/tree/master/linux_sql)]: A user-friendly solution to efficiently manage a 10-server cluster. The solution allows server users to easily monitor hardware and usage information, ensuring smooth operation and maintenance. Implemented with bash scripts, it seamlessly integrates into existing workflows. PostgreSQL (psql) is chosen as the database technology for reliable data storage. The project is implemented within a Docker container for consistent execution and compatibility. Using Git version control, development progress is tracked. This monitoring solution empowers users to optimize resource allocation, enhancing stability and efficiency of the server cluster for seamless operations.

## Highlighted Projects
**Relational Database Management System** [[GitHub](https://github.com/KunjPatel03/RelationalDatabase)]: A robust Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) to support SQL queries for performing CRUD operations and transactions on the data. The system incorporated a sophisticated parsing and validation mechanism utilizing complex regex expressions. A custom file format was implemented to efficiently store both the data and metadata associated with the RDBMS. Multiuser concurrent execution capabilities were integrated to enable simultaneous interactions with the RDBMS while maintaining data consistency. In addition, reverse engineering techniques were utilized to generate an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a visual representation of the database structure. This comprehensive RDBMS solution empowers users to effectively manage their data and leverage the power of SQL queries.

**Chess game** [[GitHub](https://github.com/KunjPatel03/Chess)]: A console-based chess game application was developed in Java, offering an engaging experience for users to play against the computer. The application adhered to SOLID principles and employed the factory design pattern to ensure maintainability and extensibility. A Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach was applied, with extensive JUnit test cases written to validate the code and modularize its components. The development process followed an Agile methodology, allowing for iterative and collaborative development. To streamline the development workflow, a CI/CD pipeline was implemented to automate monitoring and deployment processes. This comprehensive approach resulted in a well-structured and thoroughly tested chess game application, delivering a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
